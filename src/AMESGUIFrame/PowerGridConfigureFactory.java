 * A factory to control the type of gui components created.
 *
 * The need for a factory arises from adapting the AMES-2.05
 * GUI elements the more flexible data formats for the ARPAe project.
 *
 * Many of the more complex parts of ames have been stripped down
 * for the Q4 ARPAe milestones. The original GUI elements are not
 * amiable to modifactation. Instead of fighting with those components,
 * we'll extract the interface for them and create sub-classes based
 * on what functionality we need/have.
